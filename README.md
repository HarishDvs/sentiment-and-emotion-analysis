Sentiment Analysis Project

Overview

Analyze text data to classify sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) using a Naive Bayes classifier. This project processes text reviews and provides insights into user sentiment.

Features

Sentiment classification for text data.

Text preprocessing and feature vectorization.

Supports real-time or batch processing of data.

Dataset

Primary Dataset: Labeled sentiment dataset (e.g., IMDb, Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset).

Workflow

Import Dependencies: Required libraries like sklearn, nltk, pandas.

Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.

Feature Engineering: Use Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF for vectorization.

Model Training: Train a Naive Bayes model for sentiment classification.

Evaluation: Assess performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: nltk, sklearn, pandas, numpy

Tools: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab


Future Improvements

Add multi-class sentiment detection (e.g., emotions).

Integrate with real-time social media data streams.
